	<div class="about"><h1>Welcome!</h1>
		I made this page to reflect my interest in boxing. I'm currently a beginner, but so far it's been a lot of fun. I recommend taking boxing if you hate running but want cardio and also want to start learning some self defense. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Above I linked some popular boxing class locations; so feel free to browse and see if you'd be interested. The biggest downside to going to them is that they can be pretty expensive, but I think the classes are worth it because the trainers are so inspiring and can really make you want to push yourself to try your best.

		Enjoy!
